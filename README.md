# uguu-screenshooter
This will take screenshots and upload them to uguu.se <br>
This will probably be only for personal use, but feel free to use it if you want. <br>
If it turned out portable enough to use it on your own computer, have fun with it. <br>

## Dependencies
This is a stand alone program, so it shouldn't need any external screenshooter.
But what you do need the following: <br>
* curl
* xlib
* glib
<br>
